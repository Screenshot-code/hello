Elephant ear tree is also called yam,taro.</p>
<p class="first">
Scientific name is ALOCASIA ESCULATA,COLOCASIA ESCULENTA.
</p>
 <p class="second">
The elephant's-ear plant gets its name from the leaves, which are shaped like a large ear or shield. The plant reproduces mostly by means of rhizomes (tubers, corms), but it also produces "clusters of two to five fragrant inflorescences in the leaf axils".</p><pre class="two">  
Genus: Colocasia; Schott
Family: Araceae
Colocasia is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae, 
native to southeastern Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Some species are 
widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical and subtropical regions.</pre> 
<pre class="two">  
The names elephant-ear and cocoyam are also used for some other large-leaved 
genera in the Araceae, notably Xanthosoma and Caladium. The generic name is 
derived from the ancient Greek word kolokasion, which in Greek, botanist 
Dioscorides (1st century AD) may have inferred the edible roots of both 
Colocasia esculenta and Nelumbo nucifera.
The species Colocasia esculenta is invasive in wetlands along the American Gulf coast, 
where it threatens to displace native wetland plants.

  <u><strong>CULTIVATION:</strong></u>
<p class="two">
  The plant can be grown in the ground or in large containers. They are grown outside year-round in subtropical and tropical areas. In temperate regions, they are planted out for the summer and dug up and stored over winter, dry and with ventilation to prevent fungal infection. They can be grown in almost any temperature zone as long as the summer is warm. Growth is best at temperatures between 20 to 30 째C (68 to 86 째F). The plants can be damaged if temperatures fall below 10 째C (50 째F) for more than a few days.
