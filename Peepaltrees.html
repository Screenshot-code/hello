    <h2 id="climate">Environmental Impact:</h2>
            <ul>
            
                <p>Religiosa often begins life as an epiphyte, but reportedly does not parasitize other plants and relies on them only for anchorage . However, the species 
                    either splits its host plant from within or strangles it,as it matures into a tree. This is problematic to the environment in places where 
                    the species can become invasive, and means that it could also cause damage to local biodiversity in the event that the species 
                    begins to invade native ecosystems.</p>
