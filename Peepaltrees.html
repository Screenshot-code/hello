<b><u>Environmental Impact:</b></u>
Religiosa often begins life as an epiphyte, but reportedly does not parasitize other plants and relies on them only for anchorage . However, the species 
either splits its host plant from within or strangles it,as it matures into a tree. This is problematic to the environment in places where 
the species can become invasive, and means that it could also cause damage to local biodiversity in the event that the species 
begins to invade native ecosystems.
F. religiosa is reportedly invasive, potentially invasive, or weedy to parts of its native Asia as well as the Pacific, Cuba, and the USA .
